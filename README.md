- Hi, I’m @waferdp
- I’m interested in agile methodologies, devops and automation. I am a Fullstack developer, mainly in the .NET C# stack, with Vue or React. I like to dabble in python and various frontend frameworks. I started web development in 2011. 
- I’m currently fiddling around with a team performance app, written in C# and vue.js, using MongodDB. I use github actions to continuously integrate and deploy in CI. It's really refreshing to be working with frontend again. I remember why I called myself a full stack developer.
- I’m looking to collaborate on Mob programming with vs code here on github, possibly together with docker and some cloud platform.
