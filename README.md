Hi, Iâ€™m @waferdp ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m interested in agile methodologies, continuous delivery and devops. ðŸ¤– 
- I am a Fullstack developer, mainly in the .NET C# stack. 
- I have a master's degree in computer science. ðŸŽ“
- I like to learn new languages and frameworks, I consider myself good at it. ðŸ’¡
- I've been working as web application developmer since 2011. ðŸ‘´
- Iâ€™m currently fiddling around with a team performance app, written in C# and vue.js, using MongodDB. I use github actions to continuously deliver (CD) to Azure and Github pages. It's really refreshing to be working with frontend again. I remember why I called myself a full stack developer. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Mob programming with vs code here on github, possibly together with docker and some cloud platform.
