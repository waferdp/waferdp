- 👋 Hi, I’m @wafferdp
- 👀 I’m interested in agile methodologies, devops and automation. I am a C# .NET developer, before that a Java developer. I dabble in python and various frontend frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently fiddling around with a team performance app, written in C, using MongodDB.
- 👔 If you are reading this for recruitment purposes, read this: I am not looking for a new assignment. I like networking, but if you send me a cryptic message on linked-in a bout a "permanent full-time <opportunity> in Gothenburg for <role>" I will not accept the position or your network request. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mob programming with vs code and github, possibly together with docker and some cloud platform.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-brannstrom/
