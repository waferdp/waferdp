Hi, I’m @waferdp 👋
- I’m interested in agile methodologies, continuous delivery and devops. 🤖 
- I am a Fullstack developer, mainly in the .NET C# stack. 
- I have a master's degree in computer science. 🎓
- I like to learn new languages and frameworks, I consider myself good at it. 💡
- I've been working as developer since 2007, and been developing web applications since 2011. 👴
- My pet project is a team performance app, written in C# and vue.js, using MongodDB. I use github actions to continuously deliver (CD) to Azure and Github pages. It's really refreshing to be working with frontend again. I remember why I called myself a full stack developer. 
- I've vibe coded a react app for my daughter, and perhaps also my niece, with english homework. :uk:
- I’m looking to collaborate on Mob programming with vs code here on github, possibly together with docker and some cloud platform.
